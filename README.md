# Tris-with-NumPy

This notebook implements the game of **Tic-Tac-Toe (Tris)** using **NumPy** for grid management and win condition analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- Grid representation with a **NumPy array**
- Automatic win condition check by analyzing **rows, columns, and diagonals**
- Implementation of various game strategies to improve competitiveness

## 🔍 Techniques Implemented

- **Vectorized operations with NumPy** for efficient win condition checks
- **Elimination of explicit loops** for better computational efficiency
- **Game state management** to determine the end of the game

## 🎯 Game Strategies

- **randomStrategy**: makes random moves without a specific logic
- **greedyStrategy**: chooses the move that maximizes the immediate advantage
- **perfectStrategy**: plays optimally to guarantee at least a tie
- **centerCornerEdgeStrategy**: prioritizes the center, followed by corners, and then edges for optimal placement

## 📌 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

🎯 **Perfect for anyone who wants to explore NumPy applied to games!** 🚀
